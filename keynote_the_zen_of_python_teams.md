# Keynote: The Zen of Python Teams (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmvUbHtSAaM&list=PL5E-19VITtmT0foFkn2Yn25YSnREyZmeJ&index=2)

## How does the Zen of python relate to teams

https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

## Explicit is better than implicit

Healthy teams have runbooks, documentation, how to get help if there is an issue
Explicit about how to get through conflicts
Healthy teams have documents on how to interact with the team
Document your people

I enjoy working on...
I get excited by...
I struggle when...
I feel appreciated when...
Ask me for help with...

## Simple is better than complex.

Build meaningful relationships with small interactions that show we care.

## Errors should never pass silently

With code, we can write more code to raise and log errors.

With humans, we have to rely on other humans to tell us when we broke them.

Don't let things pass silently.

## In the face of ambiguity refuse the temptation to guess

Don't git blame and stew about it

Don't assume the worst

Don't explain away code ... or people.

Weekly 1:1 time is the manager's time to guess and dig-in.

## Now is better than never.

Take some action now rather than waiting for the goal.
